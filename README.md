# 🐬 Dolphinoko: Friendly Farm of AI Tools

Dolphinoko is a delightful farm-themed user interface for building and using LLM-powered agents via the Dolphin Model Context Protocol (MCP). Create and deploy character-based AI helpers with different specialties, organize them visually, and enjoy interacting with them through an accessible, warm interface. The tooling is built on local models with Ollama, with optional cloud model integration.

## ⚠️ NOTICE:
This is an experimental project provided AS IS. Use at your own risk. There may still be bugs and issues, but we're actively working to improve it!

Current development priorities:
- Finishing Anthropic integration
- Adding more character types and customization options
- Improving tool categories and persistence
- Enhanced context handling between characters and tools

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/holdmydata/dolphinoko.git
cd dolphinoko
```

2. Set up the Python backend:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the React frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Start the backend:

```bash
# From the root directory with virtual environment activated
cd backend
python main.py
```

2. Start the frontend:

```bash
# In another terminal, from the root directory
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔄 Using with Ollama

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) if you haven't already
2. Pull a model, e.g.: `ollama pull dolphin-llama3` or `ollama pull gemma:7b`
3. Make sure Ollama is running when you use Dolphinoko

## 🐱 Working with Character Agents

1. Navigate to the Character Creator page
2. Design your character:
   - Choose an animal type (cat, dog, bird, etc.)
   - Select a color and give them a name
   - Assign a role and toolCategory that fits their specialty
3. Save your character
4. Visit the Island or Chat page to interact with your new assistant!

## 🛠️ Building Your First Tool

1. Navigate to the Tool Builder page
2. Click "Create New Tool"
3. Fill in the tool details:
   - Name: A descriptive name for your tool
   - Provider: Choose "Ollama" for local models
   - Model: Select a model you've pulled to Ollama
   - Category: Select a category that matches a character's toolCategory
   - Prompt Template: Create a template using `{input}` as placeholder for user input
4. Save your tool
5. Use the Tool Organizer to properly categorize your tools
6. Interact with the appropriate character to utilize your tool!

## 📦 Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear separation between backend and frontend:

## 📝 Customization

- **UI Theme**: The farm theme can be customized in `frontend/src/styles/theme.ts`
- **Characters**: Modify available character types in `frontend/src/context/CharacterContext.tsx`
- **Tool Categories**: Edit categories in `frontend/src/types/categories.ts`
- **Adding more providers**: Extend the providers in `backend/services/mcp_service.py`

## Integrations

### Blender Integration (Model Context Protocol)

Dolphinoko includes a Blender integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows AI models to control and manipulate 3D scenes in Blender.

#### Setup Instructions

1. Install the Blender addon:
   - Find the `addon.py` file in the `assets/blender` directory
   - In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
   - Click "Install..." and select the `addon.py` file
   - Enable the addon by checking the box

2. Connect to Blender:
   - In Blender, find the "Dolphinoko" tab in the sidebar (press N if not visible)
   - Click "Connect to Dolphinoko"
   - You should see "Server Status: Running on port 9334"

3. Use the API:
   - The API endpoints are available at `/blender/`
   - You can also use the AI to control Blender by asking it to perform actions

For more detailed instructions, see the [Blender Integration README](assets/blender/README.md).
